          Sitting down to develop a website from scratch there are so many
          options and each choice will have a long lasting impact on how the
          whole project goes. Fortunately for me, some of those choices are
          easier than others

          I own what I own and I&rsquo;ve got no plans to upgrade. It was bought
          in 2016 for around Â£400 so it is more than a little out of date but I
          know it will be fine. If nothing else, I&rsquo;m going to prove that a
          high end computer is not a barrier to entry for developing a quality
          website.

        <Paragraph>
          An IDE, or integrated development environment, is the software that
          you use to write code. It helps with all sorts of things like
          highlighting code errors and making autocomplete suggestions.
          I&rsquo;m going to use VSCode, Visual Studio Code, because it&rsquo;s
          incredibly popular for JavaScript development. And it&rsquo;s built by
          Windows, so the Windows docs are good. Oh and it&rsquo;s free.

        <SubHeading level={2}>Framework</SubHeading>
        <Paragraph>
          I&rsquo;m super excited about Nextjs, it has a tonne of features that
          will make it easy to develop a quick, modern website. In computer
          programming, a framework is a whole lot of code that you import into
          to yours so that you don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel. It takes care 
          of the boring, and often complex stuff so that you can focus on the
          things that make your application unique. Some highlights of Nextjs for me are
          that it can generate static html pages from your javascript, so they
          load much faster and don&rsquo;t require lots of computing power
          from your users. And the Link component, which preloads the content of
          linked pages so that it is fast to navigate around the site.

        <Paragraph>
          I think the first couple of posts are going to feel like adverts for
          Vercel and GitHub, but honestly it&rsquo;s just genuine enthusiasm.
          I&rsquo;ve experimented with other webapps in the past and sorting out
          hosting and infrastructure is a maze of confusion. I was amazed by how
          much easier it has got. I was expecting to deal with something like
          Amazon Web Services, choose resources, and worry about accidentally
          using expensive services - no diss for AWS, it has other strengths. But
          I looked at Vercel basically because they own Nextjs and that&rsquo;s
          the framework I&rsquo;ve chosen. Everything to get a web app up and
          hosted was free and straightforward. I connected to GitHub, where
          I&rsquo;d planned to store the code, then choose the default Nextjs
          app as a starter template and within a few clicks I had an app that
          was running on the web.

        <Paragraph>
          GitHub is the best known place to store all the code, for many things
          it&rsquo;s free, and above all Vercel made it super easy to link to a
          GitHub account. GitHub is a place for storing git repositories. Git, itself,
          is a history of your code changes, that allows you to work on new changes and 
          merge them together when you are confident they are what you want. Git really 
          is a wonderful tool and one that virtually all developers use, regardless of which 
          coding language they prefer.

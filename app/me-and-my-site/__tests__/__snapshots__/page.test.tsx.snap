    Me and my site
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hi folks, I'm Mike and this is my site. Welcome! This site is primarily for me, but I'm delighted to imagine you reading it. I've made a few little apps just for fun over the years but I'm motivated to make this one for a couple of new reasons. Firstly, I know someone who wants to build a website and they came to me for some advice. I found that as much as I know how to make a huge difference to agile teams, I realised I don't really know how to put together a complete website. So I was a little embarrased. Yes, my core motivation is embarrassment. The second reason is the technology. I've been working as a tester with Nextjs apps for a couple of years now and it's so easy to work with that I figured the effort to get something up and running would be minimal. Also, Nextjs has so many features that I think it would be ready and fun to try out some different approaches on different pages.
